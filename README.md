# PyLearn-Web-App
A Django app with the goal of teaching python to its users using auto-graded tests for multiple choice and/or interactive code challenges through an online coding editor. 
This app offers 4 modules ranging from basic to more advanced python concepts, along with recap tests at the end of each chapter. The fourth chapter guides the user through the creation of a simple CRUD Task Managment App.
In each test, the user is rewarded with XP points, along with personalized feedback to enhance the learning experience.
